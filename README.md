# React Facts - Learning Project (screenshots below)

**Note:** This was a pure learning project. I didn't use any AI-autopilot or auto-code tools. Every single line was written by me to get real hands-on experience with React.

## Overview

This project is a small React application created to practice core React fundamentals.  
The goal was to understand components, JSX, styling, and project structure using Vite, rather than building a feature-heavy app.  

## Features

- Functional React components  
- Clean, component-based structure  
- Styling managed through component-specific CSS files  
- Asset handling using Vite  
- Simple and readable code written for learning purposes

## Tech Stack

- React (JSX, components)

- practicing JSX  
- organizing files in a clean, modular structure  
- getting comfortable with Vite and React together
